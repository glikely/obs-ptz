use the sample code, object code and documentation included in the SDK for the sole purpose of
developing Products using the Specific SDK, and to distribute, only in accordance with the SDK
Documentation requirements, object code included in the SDK solely as used by such Products (your
Product and compiled sample code referred to as the "Bundled Product"). If Your use of the SDK exceeds
the commercial threshold set forth in subsection b (the "Threshold"), you shall be required to enter into
a separate commercial agreement with NDI. Until such commercial agreement is executed, you shall
remain subject to the license fee obligations under this Agreement and your continued use of the SDK
shall be subject to timely payment of such fees. If no commercial agreement is signed within a reasonable
period, as determined by NDI in its sole discretion, NDI may suspend or terminate your rights under this
License, as outlined in subsections c and d.

b. Threshold: If your use of the SDK exceeds the following commercial threshold, you shall be required to
pay a license fee: Your gross revenue from sales of Bundled Product(s) exceeds 50 000 USD over any 12-
month period.

The obligation to pay the license fee arises automatically upon exceeding the commercial threshold. The
licensee shall notify NDI in writing within 15 days of exceeding the Threshold, and submit a quarterly
report detailing:
• Gross revenue derived from Bundled Product(s);
• Any other relevant metrics as reasonably requested by NDI.

Based on the reports provided, NDI shall issue an invoice for the applicable license fee based on NDI's
standard pricing. The licensee shall pay the invoice within 30 days of the invoice date. If You fail to submit
the required report within the specified timeframe, NDI may:
i) Estimate the fees due based on available data, and such estimated invoice shall be payable within
the standard payment terms unless the licensee provides accurate supporting data within 15
days; and
ii) Charge interest at 1.5% per month, calculated from the date You first exceeded the Threshold,
regardless of when the invoice is issued.

c. Compliance, Audit & Suspension: You agree to maintain accurate financial and technical records
related to Bundled Product(s). NDI may audit such records no more than once per year, with 30 days'
notice to verify compliance with this Agreement and determine whether You have exceeded the
Threshold. The audit may cover financial records related to revenue derived from Bundled Product(s) and
any other necessary information to calculate the license fee.

If an audit reveals that You have exceeded the Threshold, You shall:
i) Reimburse the shortfall plus 1.5% monthly interest from the date the Threshold was exceeded,
and
ii) Cover the reasonable costs of the audit.

If payment remains outstanding for 30 days beyond the invoice due date, NDI may:
i) Suspend the license to use and distribute Products with the SDK and block further access to the
SDK, and
ii) Charge late fees and interest until payment is made in full.

d. Breach & Termination: If You fail to pay the applicable license fee within 60 days, or submit revenue
reports for two consecutive periods, or fail to enter into a commercial license agreement within a
reasonable timeframe from when you exceeded the Threshold, this shall constitute a material breach,
and NDI may immediately terminate this Agreement without further notice. Upon termination, You must
immediately cease all use of the SDK, remove all SDK components from Your Products and discontinue its
use.

e. The Bundled Product must incorporate and be compatible with the latest version of the SDK
available at the time of such use, development, or distribution, and comply with the requirements
set forth in the SDK Documentation.
