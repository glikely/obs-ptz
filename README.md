# Build Instructions

## Linux

- Install OBS Studio including headers
  - Follow instructions for your distribution: https://obsproject.com/wiki/install-instructions
- clone this repository and build:

```
git clone https://github.com/glikely/obs-ptz
mkdir obs-ptz/build
cd obs-ptz/build
cmake ..
make
```

Copy or symlink obs-ptz.so into the OBS plugins directory.
Typically `/usr/lib/obs-plugins`.

### Debian 11 Bullseye

In Debian 11 Bullseys you can use the development package libobs-dev to build
the plugin instead of building obs-studio from source.
Do the following on Debian to get a working build environment:

```
sudo apt build-dep obs-studio
sudo apt install libobs-dev libqt5serialport5-dev
git clone https://github.com/glikely/obs-ptz
mkdir obs-ptz/build
cd obs-ptz/build
cmake ..
make
```

## Windows

To simplify development it helps to include `MSBuild`, `7-Zip`, and `Inno Setup
Compiler` in your default path (Search for 'Edit the System Environment
Variables' in the Windows search bar).

This project contains a helper script for building the plugin that assumes that
`obs-studio` and `obs-ptz` share the same top level directory.
It also assumes that Qt5 is installed under `c:\Qt\`.
If you have Qt5 installed or obs-studio checked out somewhere else then you'll
need to modify the `winbuild` and `winrun` scripts.

Both 32 and 64 bit versions of the plugin will be built if you've built both
version of OBS Studio.
Edit the script if you only want to build one version.

- Build OBS Studio using instructions on OBS-Studio Wiki:
  https://obsproject.com/wiki/Install-Instructions
- Clone this repository into a working directory
- Run `scripts\winbuild.cmd` to build the plugin
- Run `scripts\winrun32.cmd` or `scripts\winrun64.cmd` to run OBS either the
  32bit or 64bit version of the plugin

From Powershell:

```
git clone https://github.com/glikely/obs-ptz
cd obs-ptz
.\scripts\winbuild.cmd
.\scripts\winrun64.cmd
```

Use the `scripts\winbuild-rel.cmd` script to build the release version of the
plugin as a zip file and installer.
You'll first need to build a `RelWithDebInfo` version of OBS Studio before
building the release plugin.

## MacOS

- Install Homebrew
- Install Packages

```
$ brew install packages
```

- Install and build OBS Studio from source using instructions from OBS wiki:
  https://obsproject.com/wiki/install-instructions

- clone this repository and build:

```
git clone https://github.com/glikely/obs-ptz
cd obs-ptz
.github/scripts/build-macos.sh
.github/scripts/package-macos.sh
```

# Gamepad
Enable gamepad support in the settings in the Gamepad tab.
Default buttons/axis:
* left axis - zoom
* right axis - pan/tilt
* dpad up - camera select up
* dpad down - camera select down
* dpad left - preset up
* dpad right - preset down
* start - activate selected preset
* A - preset 1
* B - preset 2
* X - preset 3
* Y - preset 4
* left shoulder - preset 5
* right shoulder - preset 6
* back - preset 7
* Thumb L - preset 8
* Thumb R - preset 9

Known Issue:
It can issue many commands depending upon use which can overflow the visca over ip command buffer.
This is not noticeable usually, but the command to stop the gamepad could be missed in rare cases.
